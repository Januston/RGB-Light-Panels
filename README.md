# RGB-Light-Panels
ðŸŽ¨ Custom RGB panel designed for a prom sign, engineered to work with low voltage using Eagle ðŸ¦…. While the chip normally couldn't control eight 4-pin LEDs simultaneously, I leveraged NPN transistors and multiplexing. This technique rapidly switches LEDs on and off, making them seem illuminated simultaneously to the human eyeâ€”a blend of electronics and optical illusion.
